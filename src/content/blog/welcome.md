# Welcome to jeansy.org

This is the first post on my new personal website. I've been thinking about creating a space to share thoughts on engineering, software, and anything else that may catch my interest. I hope you enjoy it!

Stay tuned for more content, and feel free to reach out if there are topics you'd like me to explore.
