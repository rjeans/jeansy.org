# Welcome to jeansy.org

This is the first post on my new personal website. I've been thinking about creating a space to share thoughts on engineering, IT management, and the intersection of technology and leadership.

## Why This Site?

As both an engineer and IT manager, I often find myself bridging the gap between technical implementation and strategic direction. This site will be a place to explore:

- **Engineering insights**: Technical solutions, best practices, and lessons learned
- **Management perspectives**: Team building, project management, and organizational challenges
- **Industry observations**: Trends, tools, and the evolving landscape of technology

## What's Coming

I'm planning to write about:

- Code quality and architecture decisions
- Team dynamics and remote work strategies  
- Technology adoption and change management
- Career development for technical professionals

Stay tuned for more content, and feel free to reach out if there are topics you'd like me to explore.
