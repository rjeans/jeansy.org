# Building This Site with Claude Code: A Developer's Journey

After years of managing development teams and architecting systems, I decided it was time to create a personal space to share my thoughts on engineering and leadership. The twist? I wanted to explore Claude Code as my development partner.

## The Motivation

Like many engineers, I've been curious about AI-assisted development but skeptical about its practical value. As someone who's spent considerable time evaluating tools and technologies for teams, I wanted to put Claude Code through its paces on a real project - not just toy examples or contrived demos.

The goal was simple: create a minimalistic personal blog that could showcase both technical insights and management perspectives. Nothing revolutionary, but something that would require real decision-making, problem-solving, and the kind of iterative refinement that defines good software development.

## Choosing the Stack

One of the first pleasant surprises was the thoughtful approach to technology selection. Rather than defaulting to the latest trendy framework, Claude Code helped me think through the requirements:

- Minimalistic design (reflecting my preference for clean, functional interfaces)
- Markdown-based content (because I write in markdown anyway)
- Static generation (for performance and simplicity)
- Future extensibility (knowing requirements always evolve)

The recommendation was Astro with Tailwind CSS. Having worked with various static site generators over the years, I appreciated that this wasn't just a default suggestion - it was reasoned, considering both my stated goals and the broader ecosystem.

## The Development Process

What struck me most was how the development process mirrored good pair programming. Claude Code didn't just write code - it helped structure the project, created comprehensive documentation, and even suggested a development roadmap.

The workflow felt natural:
1. Discuss requirements and approach
2. Set up project structure systematically
3. Create foundational components
4. Iterate on functionality
5. Document decisions and next steps

Each step built logically on the previous one, with clear explanations of choices made. When I ran into deployment issues with Cloudflare Pages, the troubleshooting process was methodical rather than random.

## What Worked Well

**Project Organization**: The initial project structure was well-thought-out. Everything had its place, and the conventions were consistent. The TypeScript configuration, build setup, and folder organization all reflected current best practices.

**Documentation**: Perhaps most impressively, comprehensive documentation was created alongside the code. The README, hosting guide, and development roadmap weren't afterthoughts - they were integral to the development process.

**Problem-Solving**: When we hit the inevitable deployment snags (wrong Cloudflare dashboard section, incorrect build configuration), the debugging approach was systematic. No random guessing or cargo-cult solutions.

## The Challenges

**Interface Evolution**: Cloudflare's dashboard layout had changed since the training data, leading to some navigation confusion. This reminded me that documentation and interfaces evolve faster than training data.

**Deployment Nuances**: Getting the build and deploy commands right required several iterations. The difference between build commands and deploy commands for static sites isn't always obvious, even to experienced developers.

**Human Judgment**: While Claude Code suggested good defaults, the really important decisions still required human input - project goals, design preferences, content strategy.

## Reflections

As both an engineer and a manager, I found this experience enlightening. The development process felt less like working with a tool and more like collaborating with a knowledgeable colleague who happens to type very fast.

The code quality was solid - not just functional, but well-structured and maintainable. The documentation was thorough. The problem-solving approach was methodical. These are the characteristics I look for in senior developers.

But perhaps most importantly, it freed me to focus on the higher-level decisions - what this site should be, how it should feel, what stories I want to tell. The technical implementation became less of a barrier and more of an enabler.

## Moving Forward

This site represents just the beginning. The foundation is solid, the deployment pipeline works, and the development workflow is established. Now comes the harder part - creating content that's worth reading.

The real test of any tool isn't how well it handles the initial implementation, but how it supports ongoing evolution and maintenance. Based on this initial experience, I'm optimistic about the path ahead.

For fellow engineers and managers considering AI-assisted development: the technology isn't magic, but it's genuinely useful. The key is approaching it as a collaboration, not a replacement for engineering judgment.

The future of software development is looking increasingly interesting.
