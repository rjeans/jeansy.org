        Welcome to my personal corner of the internet.

      <p>
        I'm an engineer and IT manager with a passion for building great technology 
        and leading effective teams. This site is where I share my thoughts, insights, 
        and experiences from both the technical and management sides of the industry.

      <p>
        On the engineering side, I focus on creating robust, scalable solutions 
        and staying current with emerging technologies. I believe in clean code, 
        good architecture, and the importance of continuous learning.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">IT Management</h2>
      <p>
        As an IT manager, I'm interested in the human side of technology - 
        building teams, managing projects, and creating environments where 
        both people and technology can thrive.
